// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

//there is no error, it returns undefined more than once, once from console.log and then value from foo[3] which also returns undefined
